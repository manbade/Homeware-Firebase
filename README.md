# IMPORTANT

During the develop of Homeware I have dicovered that Firebase is not a reliable platform for the porpuses that I try to achive with Homeware. Due to that situation I have decided to migrate Homeware to Homeware-LAN, a similar version but design for be deployd in a Raspberry Pi and communicate with the hardware via MQTT.

Find the new repository here: https://github.com/kikeelectronico/Homeware-LAN

# Homeware
This API creates an integration between hardware devices like ESP8266 or Arduino and the Google Assitant using Firebase for the backend.

## How to

In order to works, you need to use Firebase service from Google and a hardware device like an ESP8266 or similar. Follow this steps:

1. Deploy the API following the instructions. https://github.com/kikeelectronico/Homeware/wiki
2. Connect a piece of hardware. You can use the ESP8266 examples of the Arduino Library for ESP8266 directory.
3. Learn how to create new devices and enjoy.
